This week, to be honest, we haven't have that many news. However, we are here to discuss the few news we have

### F1TV has given their shot

The race streaming service F1TV has predicted how the silly season will conclude, the most notable changes are:

(Drivers in italics are totally new in F1 and in bold are drivers which change teams)

| Team              | Driver 1         | Driver 2          |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Red Bull Racing   | Verstappen       | **Ricciardo**     |
| Ferrari           | Leclerc          | **Hamilton**      |
| Aston Martin      | **Sainz**        | Stroll            |
| Williams          | _Kimi Antonelli_ | Albon             |
| Stake Kick Sauber | Bottas           | **Hulkenberg**    |
| Mercedes          | Russell          | **Alonso**        |
| McLaren           | Norris           | Piastri           |
| Alpine            | Gasly            | **_??? Unknown_** |
| Visa CashApp RB   | _Liam Lawson_    | Tsunoda           |
| Haas              | _Oliver Bearman_ | Magnussen         |

### A tough decision to make

The worker who alledged that was being sexually attacked by Christian Horner, who was sending her innapropiate photos, has reported him formally to the FIA.
This would have little importance if it was an isolated fact, but considering all the antecedents, it could be worse than what we can imagine.

Now, it's in the RB owners' to decide whether they keep their team principal, who has been with them since 2005, and, consequently, keeping the "aerodynamic god" Adrian Newey, or maintaining their main assesor, Helmut Marko, and, as a result, the driver who has given the team the last three championships.

### Ralf Schumacher about Alonso and youth

Right after the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where Alonso almost crashes with former F1 driver Ralf Schumacher doing one of its creative ideas, Ralf Schumacher has stated the following:

> F1 cannot have a grid each time older

He is clearly not happy with drivers staying at their fourties on the car alongside people who are, perfectly, 20 years younger.

### Massa counterattacks

Following some battles in the past, Felipe Massa, former Ferrari driver has taken F1 and the FIA to court due to the loss of, how he sees it, his 2008 drivers championship.

If we look back to the last race of that year, Brazil 2008, we will notice that Massa saw the chequered flag 38 seconds before his competitor Lewis Hamilton, and that span of time was the moment when he became world champion, however, Lewis Hamilton managed to end up on the interval of positions which would secure him the world title.

Now, Massa says that 2008 was HIS championship and is moving heaven and earth to get his title, even going to court.
For now, it seems that Lewis Hamilton will remain as a 7 time world champion, but let's see how it ends.

### Pirelli about the 2026 tyres

The new regulations entering this 2026 had, amongst other things, the aim to make cars more "eco-friendly" and smaller. As a result, the FIA expressed their wishes to Pirelli to develop a tyre which would fit better those cars.

They suggested a 16-inch tyre instead of the current one which has 18 inches. Now, Pirelli has denied this proposal and says that they would have to start creating them in order to have them ready for tests in 2025, and that's simply not possible.

### Next week's schedule

We come to the first of three races where Europeans might have to wake up early because this week we're going to Melbourne, for the Australian Grand Prix
