We're back to the action, which means we have a lot of things to talk about, let's get into it.

### The weekend broke our sleep schedules

This weekend the Australian GP took place, this year with changes on it's schedule. The sessions were celebrated two hours prior as last year making it the earliest race of the season.

### The good ol' quali saturdays

The qualifying session was pretty interesting as Daniel Ricciando qualified at P18 whereas his teammate started P8, just in front of the Aston Martins. Mercedes wasn't as fast as expected, with Hamilton just shy of Q3. After his appendicitis two weeks ago, Carlos Sainz secured P2, after Max Verstappen took pole position.

### Surgery makes you a god

It was 4 am and the lights went out in Albert Park, what we wouldn't expect was the the overtake of Sainz to the reigning world champion for the lead, and how the dutchman's car caught on fire only one lap later. The lion was out of the race. It was time for a good race, one where the lead changed between drivers and... Nevermind, Carlos is unstoppable. After his surgery, he remembered his days at Toro Rosso and he adopted Red Bull's winner mentality. What followed after was the DNF of his replacement next year, Lewis Hamilton, due to a mecanical failure. We do a fast foward to the end of the race, where Fernando Alonso in defending the position like he was in Brasil 2023, but this time is not Perez, this time is Russell, who is blood thirsty, but he is in the middle of the track, after crashing into a wall, securing Alonso P6, and getting Aston Martin the push it needed, making it the fastest car in the grid and giving the spaniard his third title. But there is a problem, the stewards have started an investigation of the crash, and, after debating the best outcome for both of the drivers after an accident caused by dirty air, they imposed Fernando a 20 second penalty, demoting him to P8, crushing his dreams of the title.

### Withdrawing the driver who did nothing wrong

And where is Logan Sargeant, the backmarker of our hearts? We don't know. The official retransmittion has not showed him at any moment of the race, as he didn't participate after an Albon crash which broke Alex's chassis made Williams make the decision of letting down Sargeant and replacing him with Albon, who competed with his car.
