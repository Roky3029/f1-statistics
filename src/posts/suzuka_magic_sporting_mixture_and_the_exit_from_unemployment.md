This week we're talking about the Japanese Grand Prix, the purchase of MotoGP and some rumours there are on the paddock, so there we go!

### Japanese GP

#### Qualifying

After a wet FP2 and an FP3 that left us with a lot of doubts about how teams would perform, it was time for qualifying. Kevin Magnussen was the first to make a lap, while top teams waited for a later moment. Q1 was a rough patch for Charles Leclerc, who had to use a second set of softs, to secure Q2. Zhou, Sargeant, Magnussen, Gasly and Stroll (Whose teammate was in P2 at the time), were the slowest drivers on the grid that day. Esteban Ocon, after his Q1 performance putting him in P13, celebrated with his team.

The second stage of qualifying was more linear, as the Red Bulls secured a 1-2 on the first and second run. The first of the rest was Lewis Hamilton, with Lando Norris behind him. Ocon, Albon, Bottas, Hulkenberg and Ricciardo were eliminated. Tsunoda, the local driver, was the one to eliminate his teammate.

The definitive grid positions were almost the same, with Max Verstappen taking pole position, Checo Perez behind him, and in third position, Lando Norris. The shock came when Leclerc qualified on P8 and the Mercedes were P7 and P9.

#### Race

The lights went out and if we blinked, we would had lost track of what was happening, as Alex Albon and Daniel Ricciardo crashed shortly after the start of the race, causing a red flag. The rest of the race was pretty linear, with some strategic action and Leclerc's comeback, who finished P4. Yuki Tsunoda scored points on his home soil, where no Japanese driver had done it in 12 years.

### Liberty Media buys MotoGP

Liberty Media, the owner of F1, has bought the rights of MotoGP, opening the possibility of Grand Prix weekends where the two categories took place, and some multi-class exhibitions. Marcelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna, the former owner of the category has expressed his feelings about the deal:

> This is the perfect next step in the evolution of MotoGP,
> and we are excited about what this milestone brings to Dorna,
> the MotoGP paddock and race fans. We are proud of the global
> sport we have grown, and this transaction is a testament
> to the value of the sport today and its growth potential.
> Liberty Media has an incredible track record in developing sporting assets
> and we couldn't wish for a better partner to expand MotoGP's fan base around the world.

### Carlos Sainz future

Carlos Sainz, current Ferrari driver who is being replaced by Lewis Hamilton next year, is believed to sign with Mercedes for 2025 onwards. As previously rumoured, Audi would be another choice, but, taking the state of Sauber's infrastructure right now, it wouldn't be the rational choice.

### This week's schedule

This week is free of F1, but if you want the thrills of competition and you don't have anything to watch, Formula E Misano E-Prix is taking place this weekend.
