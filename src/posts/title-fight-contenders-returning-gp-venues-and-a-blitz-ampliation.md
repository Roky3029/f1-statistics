This is the last week without any action on the track, and, as in last week, we're full of news, so, let's look at them!

### The big five

#### Livery Recap

Same as last week, this one has been full of presentations, them being about the cars, in contrast of the livery reveals we've had beforehand. Monday at 8 AM was the starting point of the events, with Aston Martin hosting an event at their factory. Although they organized everything and hosted it, it was exclusive for the people who went there. For the rest of us, they had prepared a 1 minute video that launched precisely at 8 AM. Later that day, the car was driven around Silverstone.

Next day, it was turn for Ferrari, who left the black behind in one of the most beautiful liveries they have had for some years. They did it in a similar fashion as the English team, a short video showing the car, and later that day, they drove it around Fiorano Circuit. This time, without an exclusive event.

Mercedes and McLaren were next on the line, on Wednesday. Mclaren announced the car, as they had showed the livery some weeks ago. Mercedes did it in a more classic way, a proper presentation, with drivers and people from the team talking. They are returning little by little to their "Silver arrows" nickname, with a transition from silver to the black that we've seen from 2020 onwards except for 2022.

Thursday was the turn of the reigning champions, Red Bull, that did a proper event. Unfortunately, their livery didn't change, as Verstappen spoiled on one of his livestreams.

#### Car analysis

Let's leave behind the liveries and enter to a more technical space, Red bull has eliminated the air intake at their sidepod, moving it inwards and making it vertical. We don't really know if this makes aerodynamical sense, but, being designed by Adrian Newey, it will. They have also said something that nobody would expect. This design is only going to be used for the first three races, moving to a no-sidepod scheme like Mercedes did, which didn't work for them.

Aston Martin, by the other hand, has gambled all to an aggresive design continuing with the car they had in Canada last year but didn't understand. The sidepods seems to be floating, in an effect that surely is arousing while on track.

The rest of the teams have gone more to the RB19's path, copying what the Austrian team did last year.

### The pretendants for a Grand Prix

There could be some returning venues to the sport we all love, and this time, with permanent tracks. South Korea would want to host a GP around the Incheon Airport. They are planning the build of a permanent circuit there, and it could attract around 200K spectators.

TÃ¼rkiye would also want to take part on the championship, with the returnal of Istambul Park circuit, witness of a Lance Stroll Pole Position and Sir Lewis Hamilton 7th title.

### Blitz Ampliations on Horner's matter

Christian Horner has denied all of the accusations of innapropiate behaviour, while at the same time, press states that the victim is filling a lawsuit against him.

> The accusations are incorrect.
> There are no divisions in the team
> -Christian Horner
