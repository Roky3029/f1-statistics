Time for the announcements! We're entering the most important week on the presentations, and with that said, time for the news:

### Carbon fibre epidemic

The week started with Williams announcing their livery. Not the car, but their color scheme. It is almost the same as last year's, but, with a lot of exposed carbon fibre. It looks like this is the new trend on the grid, as everyone but Visa Cash App RB has stripped a lot of paint out of their car. Later that day Stake Kick Sauber did the same, only showing how the car will look and nothing else. Some highlights in fluor green and black everywhere, not because of paint, but because of the lack of it. Thursday was the turn of Alpine, with another blue and pink livery, but not really. Another team that follows the tendency of not painting their car. Finally friday came, and we saw it, a colorful car, Visa Cash app RB. The resemblance to Toro Rosso late-days liveries is uncanny, dark blue and chrome. Personally, my favourite for now.

### Christian Horner the (allegedly) horny

Red Bull has opened an investigation to Christian Horner, their team principal, for innapropiate behaviour to a worker. It it said by some media that it is because of his aggresive way of leading the team, but the majority declare that he sent nude photographs of him to a female worker. For now, nothing is official, and probably it wouldn't be until the start of the season that something is said by Red Bull itself.

Following with this topic, there is a rumour that Horner is going to quit his position, and if that was the case, Helmut Marko could be Red Bull's new team principal. Adrian Newey could also exit the Austrian team, as his contract is allegedly linked to Christian's.

### The hurricane that Hamilton left behind

After the announced departure of Sir Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes, the drivers have started to talk. Esteban Ocon is the one who has said the most, talking about his links to Mercedes in the middle of Alpine's presentation.

> It is clear that I've got good links with Mercedes
> and I'm still managed by them in a way similar to
> a junior even if I'm not a junior anymore.

He also has declared that Mick Schumacher deserves to be in F1. The "Kaiser"'s son has viewed himself in that Mercedes seat, but he also knows that the decision isn't his.

Another change the German team can have is on their insides, as some engineers could accompany Hamilton in his departure. Peter "Bono" Bonnington is the one whose name is the most mentioned while talking about this.

Red Bull's driver pairing could also be modified because of the British signing with Ferrari, as they could be interested in Alex Albon to reinforce their team.

### An all-stakes trial

Sauber's main sponsor, Stake, has been hit by some problems with the justice. The Dutch company isn't registered in Switzerland Federal Casino Comission, and, with that country being the home of Sauber Motorsports, it is potentially illegal for the team to be named after it. The lawsuit against Stake could ascend Kick as Sauber's main sponsor, like it happens in countries where gambling advertisement is not permitted.

### This week's presentations

This is the last week of presentations, where all of the big teams are going to announce their livery, and some, their actual car.
